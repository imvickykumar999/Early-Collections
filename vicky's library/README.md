After this project, I understood, I think somehow, that how import works actually...
I got this Project Idea from Visualizing Anaconda's Library files in folders.

Importing user defined library means calling a .py format file in which 
each line of python script will be executed from print command to function call, 
either class or function... in nested stack manner.

All the library files must be in same folder and hierarchy of folder must be followed.

...edited : this is appended from github (README.md) editor.
